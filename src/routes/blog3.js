                    <summary>What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?</summary>
                    Command line interface or Terminal is something that I would have avoided before starting this bootcamp. Mainly because from previous experience of people causing issues with their computers by using it incorrectly. 
                    Command Line interface is no longer this scary black box that I am afraid of using on my computer. 
                    It is actually very helpful to quickly get things saved and pushed to github from gitpod(IDE). 
                    It also allows you to easily run programs or added packages to your project as well. The options with it seem limitless compared to our initial routine of git add/commit/push at the start of the bootcamp.

                    If I were to build a CLI, then I would build something that would improve performance or something that would perform a task that is being used very often. 
                    Anything that helps improve or speeds up the ability to work.

                    <summary>List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code</summary>
                    In relation to using both Bootstrap and React with recent projects. There is most likely a lot that could be listed here since they both provide so many different things that may have taken longer to type without. 
                    Bootstrap for instance provides you with a lot of front-end components which can even be used in React still. For example, you can easily get a ready to go navbar without having to get it ready from scratch. 
                    Take that navbar and even use it as a reuseable component within react via multiple pages. On the react side, you can route different pages fairly quickly with very little code. Which both could save you plenty of time from needing to produce similar code.

                       <summary>Now that you are halfway through bootcamp, what has been the biggest hurdle that you have gone past? What do you think is going to be the next biggest thing to power through?</summary>
                       My biggest hurdle that I was able to make past was knowing when to ask for help. After attempting to figure something out after a long period of time, I've learned to use the resources around me to get a better understanding. 
                       I have a culture ingrained in me that in a professional setting that asking for help means that you are not good enough. Being in an environment that allows you to fail and actually doing so to improve has really improved upon on how I learn and how much I learn as a person. 
                       My next biggest hurdles I believe is becoming fully Independent to be able to handle any task that is thrown at me and at the rate at which I am able to complete these tasks. Which I believe will come with time and practice.

                       I believe that my ideas are changing or maybe just growing as I learn more throughout the bootcamp. There are multiple different websites I could build, games could even be an option now, or maybe something that is both Front-end and Back-end related. 
                       We have just touched the surface of back-end. Which would make me lean more towards like a website currently. Although I have to take into account my limitations and not try to focus on making a dream project or maybe even a game would be too much currently for me. 
                       I guess we will see in due time.

                       <summary>What surprised you about your first week in Python and how was it different from your first week in JavaScript?</summary>
                       I was surprised at how clean and easy to read that python can sometimes be. You have to be very aware of your spacin, but your IDE does a decent job of making it clear if there is an issue. 
                       I also much prefer the use of Self in Python vs. This in Javascript. I would say that some concepts that carried over did make it a lot easier to pick up due to already having experience with Javascript. 
                       I think starting over or learning something new is always a challenge, but this time I didn't feel like I was starting from nothing.

                       <summary>What are some similarities and differences you can see with JS and Python?</summary>
                       You start to really see how similar coding is across different languages after making the jump from the first language you learn. 
                       Javascript and Python are both object-oriented languages while Python is geared toward back-end and Javascript is mainly geared toward Front-end. 
                       The difference that I actually ended up enjoying was the way Python defines code blocks vs. Javscript curly braces to group. Switching to just needing to have the blocks indented to be much easier to read. 
                       Although it may have been easier to grasp because of already spending so much time with Javascript. Which both languages have either a List or Array to store values, but Python additionally has Tuples which is very similar to lists but immutable.

                       <summary>If you had started with Python instead of JS, how do you think the Bootcamp would be different? Would you have benefited?</summary>
                       I feel like starting with the front-end and working on the back-end is the right way to go with learning since it allows you to visually see how web-development works visually and then what is behind the curtains. 
                       This type of what if is hard to answer because honestly, it could go either way depending on the person. I think it would be different because we would have to work backwards from the back-end and connect it to the front-end which may be more jarring when learning together within the boot camp. 
                       Although having any coding experience prior would always be a bonus regardless of the language, but I think JS to Python was the way to go. Personally, I'm starting to find myself leaning more back-end oriented but have enjoyed it all. 
                       I feel like either way the benefits of switching the order would still come with their own challenges as well.

                       I've been looking around at some different APIs that could be interesting to use for a Final Project. Haven't really settled on a single one, but some interesting gaming APIs that allow you to display data from an account you search. 
                       Which there are plenty of sites that do this already, but would be cool to make one that I could use for a Multiplayer game that I enjoy.

                       <summary>What are your thoughts about how far you have come? How has your Digital Literacy, Computational Thinking, and Adoption of Coding Culture increased</summary>
                       I've found it can be really easy to minimize how far you really come if you don't take a step back to realize it. Before starting this bootcamp, I had basically no coding experience and only hardware experience. 
                       One the very first things that we learned was Github for this bootcamp. At the time, that seemed like a challenge, but now we use it so often and easily with our projects. 
                       Now we have learned so many things within both Front-end and Back-end. My ability to locate useful resources and how to tackle a problem has changed as well. The most helpful thing for me is to break down a project/problem into a much smaller pieces. 
                       I've learned that it is much easier to tackle building something that way instead of trying to do it all at once. After taking a step back, I can say I am proud of my progress even though I felt like I had a really rough start. 
                       I am proud that I did not give up even when I felt like I was not good enough. I will take what I've learned from this bootcamp and continue to learn even after.

                       I believe that I may struggle more with the Front-End after getting to experience the Back-end. Alignment and styling aspect of the front-end is something that may get easier with more practice with it but I still struggle with it.

                       It would be nice to hear from some companies that primarily focus on the back-end as well for jobs. Anything that may be Database focused, but one I can think of locally is bitwerx.
